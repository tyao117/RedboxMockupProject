We implemented the following three insert methods and compared the time it took to complete all the inserts.
The target was a table with 21097 inserts incoming with 100 data elements already in the table.
Notes, time was measured with system time.

method 1: each insert has 2 queries
	  query 1: query to check for repeat
	  query 2: insert query

method 2: create an in-memory table of data
	  check the in-memory table for repeat 
	  insert query

method 3: create and in-memory table of data
	  check the in-memory table for repeat
	  write data to a file
	  load all the written data into mysql

Method 1 took 100644 miliseconds to complete.
Method 2 took 25446 miliseconds to complete.
Method 3 took 158 miliseconds to complete.
